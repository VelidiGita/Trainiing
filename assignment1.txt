variables:-
***********
- variables are used to store the data / values / literals.

types of variables:-
*******************
1.var :- re-intitialization is possible
        re-decalration is possible
2.let:- re-intitialization is possible
        re-decalration is not possible
3.const:-  re-intitialization is not possible
        re-decalration is not  possible

ex: - var username = "Rakesh";
    console.log(username);

    - extension of javascript file  must be ".js".

    console.log() :- it is a method to print the output in the developer console.
    document.writeln():- it is a method to print the output on the UI.

what is comment?
-comments are the ignored lined by the browser.
-to give an information to the developers.

two type of comments in js:-
****************************
html :- <!-- comment to be done -->
css :- /* ulkdsjvl */

js:-
1.single line comment - (//)
2.multi-line comment - (//)


what is data types?
-datatypes used to specify what kind of data stored in the variable.

types of data types:-
*********************
1.primitive data types:-
- they are built-in
- immutable
- they can store only a single values
    -string
    -number
    -boolean
    -undefined
    -null
    -symbol
    -bigint

2.non-primtitive data types:-
- they are user defined
- mutable
- they can store multiple values.
    -array
    -functions
    -objects
    -math , date , json

Strings:-
**********
-sequence of characters enclosed within "" , '' , ``(template literals/backtiks)

number:-
- -2^53-1 to +2^53-1 upto this range we consider as number data type.
- beyond this range it will be bigint.

boolean :- true / false.

undefined:- variable is declared but not initialized with the value.

null:-null is empty value / absence of an object.
- return type of null is "object".

bigint:- any value exceed the range of number dattype we consider that as bigint.
- any value sufix with "n" will be bigint.

Functions:
- function is a block of code used to excute specific task assigned to 
- function is a non-primitive datat type
- function can be reusable

syntax: - function function_name(optional parameters){ //function decalration
                //statements
                }
            function_name(arguments);

Types of functions:-
1.named function: function which is having a name and invoked with the same name.
2.anonymus function: function which doesnot have a name to declare and to invoke.
3.function expression: ananonymus function declaration is assigned to a and invoked with the same variable
4.Immediate invoke function expression(IIFE): once the function is created Immediately it should be invoked.
 - it can be executed only once.
5.Arrow function: it is used to concise the normal function syntax
syntax:- ()=>{};
- arrow function is similar to anonymus function.
6.Higher order function:
7.Callback function:
- closure 

Note:-
- current version of JS is es14.
- es6:- is a stable version.
es - ECMA JavaScript
ECMA - european computer manufacturing association

//let x = ()=>console.log("Arrow function");
// x();

//let x = a=>console.log(a);
// x(5);

//let x = (a,b)=>console.log(a+b);
// x(5,5);

arrays:
- array can store multiple values within a single variable.
- collections of items/values
- array can store homogenous values and heterogenous values.
Syntax :- [] 
ex :- 
            
map and forEach diff::
map:- it is used to iterate the values of an array one by one.
- it will return new array from the original array.

forEach:- it is used to iterate the values of an array.
- if we return the value we will get "undefined"

methods in array:
push(),pop(),unshift(),shift(),reverse(),join()
concat()

what is object?
- object is an entity which is used to store the values in the form of key and value pairs.
- object is a physical entity which is having states(properties) and behaviours

syntax:- int obj=(); 
note:- object based language - 
Ex:- int obj=(
           name="ritu";
           age=20;
           );

map():- it is used to iterate values from the array.
      - if we return the value, map() method returns new copied array.

forEach():- it is used to iterate the values from the array.

what is object?
- object is an entity which is having states(properties) and behaviours.
- object is used to store the data in the form of key and vallue pairs.

syntax:-  let obj - {};

note:- "this" - it is used to target current executing objects.

JSON:- Javascript object notation.
- JSON is a lightweight techinique of javascript used to transf.er data/information from 
  client to server and vice-versa.
- except number it will store but key 

- JSON is always in the form of "string".
methods of Json:-
1.JSON.stringify():- it is used to convert javascript object into JSON object.
2.JSON.parse() :- it is used to convert JSON object into javascript object.


Asynchronous in javascript:-
- to perform multiple task in javascript.

1.setTimeout():- it is a web api used to perform async operations at 
syntax:-  setTimeout(Callbackfn, timeout);

2.setInterval():- it is a web api used to perform async operations at 
syntax:-  setInterval(Callbackfn, timeout);

3.promise:- promise is an object which represents eventual completion or failures of an async operations.
   states of promise:-
   1.pending state
   2.fulfilled state
   3.rejected state

syntax:-  let p = new Promise((resolve,  reject)=>{});  

- the actaul way of executing the promise is instance methods,
    1.then():- it is used to execute fulfilled state
    2.catch():- it is used to execute rejected state
    3.finallY():- once promise is settled it will print the value


4.async & await:-
async:- async keyword is used to convert synchronous function into asynchronous function and 
        start to execute the
await:- await keyword is used to make the function to wait untill the promise completes.
note:- by default, javascript is synchronous(single threaded).

DOM:-
- DOM stands for document object model.
- DOM is used to add, remove , update content in the html document.
- DOM is used to manipulate the content in the html document.

DOM methods:-
1.document.getElementById(""):- it is used to select or target the html element based on "id attribute" value.
                              - id attribute should be unique/ it should be used with one element.

2.document.getElementByClassName(""):- it is used to select the html element based on "class attribute" value.
                                    - class attribute can be used with multiple elements with common value.

3.document.getElementByTagName(""):- it is used to select html element based on tag names.

4.document.getElementsByName(""):- it is used to select html element based on "name attribute" value.

- these below methods select the html elements based on css selectors.
5.document.querySelector(""):- it selects only one element.
6.document.querySelectorAll(""):- it will selects multiple elements.

innerText:- it is a property used to manipulate just plain text.
innerHTML:- it is a property used to add / remove the content along with tags.

Events in DOM:-
- events are nothing but actions performed on html elements.
- events are of click 

dynamic creation of html element from javascript:-
- to create a dynamic element in javascript we have a method callled as "document.createElement
- to create an attribute we have a method called as "setAttribute()".
- to remove attribute we have a method "removeAttribute()".
